# PHP MVC PROJECT: DOMAIN EXPIRY

Thank you very much for offering your time to seeing my project!

## Project purpose 
Store domains and some details about them (domain name, domain expiry date, hosting expiry date, owner domain name, hosting company and other details). Idea of doing that project came when a old customer called me and asked when his domain/hosting will expire. Today I am happy to offer that answer to all my customers I was working for, my platform contain the domains details.
While the platform contains real domain names and them details I can offer access just on discution purpose but I will describe below all the functionality.

> ## The DOMAINEXPIRY platform does:
> - access only using a login form: http://domainexpiry.topwebdeveloper.co.uk/logins
> - **password resset** that require my personal email: http://domainexpiry.topwebdeveloper.co.uk/passwords
> - after login you will see the domain list (is working just if you know the login password): http://domainexpiry.topwebdeveloper.co.uk/domains
> - there are 3 Bootstrap Modals that allow you to **edit details/view details/delete domain**
> - the next menu button is **Add Domain** that show a form that has all fileds mandatory (http://domainexpiry.topwebdeveloper.co.uk/domains/add)
> - the next menu button is **Black List**: here I can see the IP's that tried to login using a wrong password (http://domainexpiry.topwebdeveloper.co.uk/domains/blacklist). Could be a friend, reason I have made also a **Remove from black list** option
> - the next menu button is **Logout** that make redirect to the **Login** form.
